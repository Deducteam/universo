- checker.ml suppose that the second argument is a sort. One can make that generic using rewrite rules
- 4 universes is not enough for the whole library but almost (39 files on 40).
- One should understand why the function in vector_finset cannot be encoded in 3 universes.
- Enrich Makefile's rule so that we do not type check many many times the same files.
- use import_signature for theory file
- create a configuration file and its format
- Have a way to disallow constraints for some identifier
- Have a way to instrument the solver (such as z3) to allow LRA for example
- Figure out how the solver can be speed up
- having a smt2 problem
- configure the minimum/maximum of universes
- FIx makefile
