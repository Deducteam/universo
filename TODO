- some dkos are generated at the root level, why?
- 4 universes is not enough for the whole library but almost (39 files on 40).
- One should understand why the function in vector_finset cannot be encoded in 3 universes.
- Figure out how the solver can be speed up
- Clean code with new API
- Have a better documentation
- Document configuration file --> it should be optional
